BLG 252E OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING HOMEWORK -3 

For this homework assignment, you will be designing a restaurant by using polymorphism. The restaurant has five empty tables, the tables could include more than one customer so more than one dishes/beverages can be ordered at the same time. There will be no limitations in the number of customers or the orders. The restaurant has three types of ingredients (type1, type2 and type2) to be served in different types of quantities (grams, units or milliliters). You are also expected to write a checkout system as well as different classes to simulate this restaurant. The checkout system will simply calculate the bill to be paid (total cost + tax + tips) and to be printed out on the screen.
